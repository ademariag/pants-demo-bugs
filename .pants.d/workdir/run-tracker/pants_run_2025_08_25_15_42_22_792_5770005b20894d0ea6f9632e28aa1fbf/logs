CycleException: The dependency graph contained a cycle:
-> docker_dynamic_labels:base
-> docker_dynamic_labels:base

To fix this, first verify if your code has an actual import cycle. If it does, you likely need to re-architect your code to avoid the cycle.

If there is no cycle in your code, then you may need to use more granular targets. Split up the problematic targets into smaller targets with more granular `sources` fields so that you can adjust the `dependencies` fields to avoid introducing a cycle.

Alternatively, use Python dependency inference (`--python-infer-imports`), rather than explicit `dependencies`. Pants will infer dependencies on specific files, rather than entire targets. This extra precision means that you will only have cycles if your code actually does have cycles in it.
